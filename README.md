# hello-world
This is my first repository as part of my learning how to use GitHub

I am doing this as i'm taking CS50 2018.

Let's see where this goes.

Update from May 19

I have taken up learning Git once again after a haitus of a year. 

have also downloaded and installed local by flywheel, a wordpressm local environment that seems promising. Hoping to use that and git together for my wordpress dev workflow. Lets see how we progress on it.
